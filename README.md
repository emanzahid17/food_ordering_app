Food Ordering App

This project is a Food Ordering App built using Python. It allows users to add, modify, and remove items from their cart, view prices with and without tax, and finally place an order.

The project serves as a great demonstration of basic Python programming concepts such as variables, data types, conditional statements, loops, and functions.

Features

Add items to cart: Select food items and add them to your cart.
Remove items from cart: Remove any unwanted items.
Modify item quantity: Adjust the quantity of items in your cart.
View cart: Check whatâ€™s in your cart before placing an order.
Placing order (checkout): Review and place your final order.
Exit the app: Quit the app when finished.

The app also calculates:

Price before tax: Total cost of items in the cart, excluding tax.
Tax price: The tax amount applied to the order.
Total price after tax: Final total after adding tax.


Project Breakdown
To complete the project successfully, I broke down the entire app idea into smaller, manageable tasks:

Set up the project structure: Define the overall flow of the app and how different actions will be handled.
Implement Python basics: Use core Python concepts to bring the app to life.


Key Python Concepts Implemented

Variables: Store item details, prices, and cart contents.
Data types: Work with strings, integers, and floats for item names, quantities, and prices.
Conditional statements: Manage user interactions and decisions (e.g., checking if the cart is empty).
Loops: Iterate through cart items and handle user inputs.
Built-in functions: Leverage Python's built-in functions like print(), input(), and len().
User-defined functions: Create custom functions to handle adding/removing items, calculating totals, and displaying the cart.



Future Improvements:

Add a menu with a larger variety of food items.
Implement discount coupons.
Add user authentication for personalized orders.

This project showcases the application of Python fundamentals in building a functional, real-world app. By breaking down the project into smaller chunks and focusing on each feature individually, I was able to successfully complete the app while reinforcing key programming concepts.

Enjoy ordering food with this Python-based app! ðŸ˜„
